## Changelog

- [docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md)

## Controls

### In Hand
- `Left`: Fold
- `OK`: Commit the current action (`Check`, `Call`, or `Raise`)
- `Up/Down`: Increase or decrease the current bet amount
- `Right`: Reset the current bet amount to the default call/check value

### Global
- `Back` short:
  - From the game screen: open Controls Help
  - From menu screens: close or cancel the current menu
- `Back` hold (1.5s): open `Exit Hold 'em`

### Exit Menu
- `OK`: Save and exit
- `Back` short: Cancel
- `Back` hold (1.5s): Exit without saving

## Save Behavior

Save path:
- `/ext/apps_data/holdem/save.bin`

Startup behavior when a save exists:
- `OK`: Load save
- `Back`: Start a new game and delete the previous save

There is only one save slot by design.

## Fairness and RNG

Card dealing fairness is based on:
- Hardware RNG via `furi_hal_random_fill_buf`
- Fisher-Yates shuffle across all 52 cards before each hand

Current bounded random selection uses modulo reduction (`value % upper_bound`).

What this guarantees:
- No duplicate cards in a hand
- A full-deck shuffle every hand
- No AI influence over card distribution

What remains open for future improvement:
- Replace modulo reduction with rejection sampling to eliminate modulo bias entirely

## Firmware Notes

Target/API:
- Target 7
- API 87.1

The app is intended for official firmware and compatible forks, including Momentum, as long as they preserve external-app API compatibility.
